## Description
The Celestial objects project is an interactive 2D simulator which lets you controll the
physics of a  multi celestial bodies system (planets, stars, etc) through Newtonian physics,
such as the gravitanial constant G, the power by which the distance is raised (normally 2).
It also draws factors and let's you control the direction of time, set  favourite celestial object
at rest showing relative motion.
