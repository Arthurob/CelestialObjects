## Description
The Celestial objects project is an interactive 2D simulator which lets you controll the
physics of a  multi celestial bodies system (planets, stars, etc) through Newtonian physics 
(using the Runge-Kutta method), such as the gravitanial constant G, the power by which the distance is raised (normally 2).
It also draws vectors and lets you control the direction of time.
It startedout of interest to see how celestial bodies behave when the gravitational laws are changed and
at the same time dive more into interactive animations using python.

## Installation
Runs on python 3.x
Used packages:
pygame
math
numpy
random
string

Main branch:
pygame


TK Inter:
tkinter



## Branches
The main branch currently uses pygame. Even though the Tkinter version contains more feautures,
performance issues, cleaner coding and more control favours the pygame as graphics intercace.
